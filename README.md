Exercise 2: Move the plane
==========================

Connect the control wheel of the plane to the orientation sensor of the device.

A decorator for the Android orientation sensor (RotationSensor) is given:

    * provide streams for X, Y, Z rotations in degrees
    * start listening to the sensor when there is a subscriber
    * stop listening to the sensor when there is no subscriber
    
Make the build green.
